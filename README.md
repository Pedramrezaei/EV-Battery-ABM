# EV Battery Circularity ABM

Agent-based model to study electric vehicle battery circularity in the Netherlands, focusing on second-life applications and the goal of 100% circularity by 2050.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the ABM
  - `agents/`: Agent class definitions
  - `models/`: Core model implementation
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `data/`: Input data and parameters
- `docs/`: Documentation and model description
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Model

[Instructions to be added]

## Key Components

1. Agent Types:
   - EV Owners
   - Car Manufacturers
   - Recycling Facilities
   - Battery Refurbishers

2. Key Processes:
   - Primary battery lifecycle
   - End-of-first-life decisions
   - Second-life applications
