abstract = {Although not yet developed in Europe, second-use of traction batteries enables an extension of their lifetime and potentially improves life cycle environmental performance. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) offer the most promising chemistry for traction batteries in electric vehicles (xEVs) and for second-use. Due to the novelty of the topic and the expected increase of e-mobility in the next decades, more efforts to understand the potential consequences of second-use of batteries from different perspectives are needed. This paper develops a dynamic, parameterised Material Flow Analysis (MFA) model to estimate stocks and flows of LIBs after their removal from xEVs along the specific processes of the european value-chain. Direct reuse, second-use and recycling are included in the model and parameters make it customisable and updatable. Focusing on full and plug-in electric vehicles, LIBs and energy storage capacity flows are estimated. Stocks and flows of two embedded materials relevant for Europe were also assessed (cobalt and lithium). Results showed that second-use corresponds to a better exploitation of LIBs’ storage capacity. Meanwhile, Co and Li in-use stocks are locked in LIBs and their recovery is delayed by second-use; depending on the slower/faster development of second-use, the amount of Co available for recycling in 2030 ranges between 9% and 15% of Co demand and between 7 and 16% for Li. Uncertainty of inputs is addressed through sensitivity analysis. A variety of actors can use this MFA model to enhance knowledge of second-use of batteries in Europe and to support the effective management of LIBs along their value-chain.}

abstract = {Understanding the lithium-ion battery (LIB) nonlinear degradation is essential for battery full-lifespan usage and management. In this study, LIBs are cycled under conditions of low-temperature and high-current charging respectively. By designing a multi-battery parallel aging experiment, the evolution process and changing regulation of lithium ions (Li-ions) loss are quantified. The amount of irreversible lithium loss caused by two side reactions, i.e., the side reaction of SEI film growth and irreversible lithium plating, within the full lifespan of LIBs is measured and analyzed, which reveals that irreversible lithium plating is the dominant reason causing the battery nonlinear degradation. With the quantitative results above, an electrochemical aging coupled model is established, which agrees well with the experimental nonlinear aging. Furthermore, a simulation of the battery secondary capacity diving is conducted, and the formation of the nonlinear aging mechanism is revealed. A porosity reduction theory is proposed, in which the capacity diving of the battery is caused by the exponential growth of irreversible lithium plating, while the exponential growth phenomenon is due to the positive feedback loop formed by the porosity reduction of the negative electrode and the irreversible lithium plating.}
